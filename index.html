        <p>Kacie transforms schools by helping teachers integrate computer science across their curriculum.
            She is helping to shape our future by giving teachers and students skills they need for jobs 
            that don't even exist yet. The curriculum she supports surrounds game-based learning and programming.
            Students learn block-based coding in Scratch, Lego WeDo, Lego Minestorms, and MakeCode. Students build
            and create with robotics and Minecraft Education Edition.</p>

        <p>Kacie is a mom, maker, and wannabe baker. She loves looking for inspiration. From that, she makes and shares
            in hopes of inspiring others.
